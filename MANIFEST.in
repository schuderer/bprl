# setup.py, setup.cfg and MANIFEST.in work together when creating distributions
# using `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
# Note: MANIFEST.in does not affect binary distributions such as wheels.

# MANIFEST.in is part of the distutils which setup.py internally uses.
# It is needed when you need to package additional files that are not
# automatically included in a source distribution.
