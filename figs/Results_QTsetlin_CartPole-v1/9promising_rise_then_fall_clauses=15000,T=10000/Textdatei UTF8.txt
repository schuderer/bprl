    T: int = 10000   # 4000  # TODO try multiples of num clauses; As a strategy for problems where the number of clauses is unknown, and for real-world applications where noise plays a significant role, the RTM can be initialized with a much larger T. Then, since the output, yo, is a fraction of the threshold, T, the error decreases.
    s: int = 2.5  # 2  # For instance, if someone [increases s to 4], clauses will start to learn much finer patterns, such as (1 0 .), (1 1 .), and (0 1 .). This significantly increases the number of clauses needed to capture the sub-patterns.
