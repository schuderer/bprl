    T: int = 15000  # 4000  # TODO try fractions of num clauses; As a strategy for problems where the number of clauses is unknown, and for real-world applications where noise plays a significant role, the RTM can be initialized with a much larger T. Then, since the output, yo, is a fraction of the threshold, T, the error decreases.
